        <h2 class="sub_title">Karl Benz</h2>
        <div class="big_block">
          <div class="sub_block">
            <p>
              Karl Benz, a name synonymous with the genesis of the automobile,
              stands as a towering figure in the annals of automotive history.
              Born on November 25, 1844, in Karlsruhe, Germany, Benz was a
              visionary engineer and inventor whose contributions laid the
              foundation for the modern automotive industry. His journey began
              with a profound interest in mechanics and engineering, leading him
              to pursue studies at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Benz's
              early career was marked by experimentation and innovation, setting
              the stage for his groundbreaking work in developing the first
              practical automobile.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="sub_block">
            <p>
              The turning point in Benz's career came with his creation of the
              Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1885-1886, a vehicle that is widely
              regarded as the world's first practical automobile. This
              three-wheeled vehicle was powered by an internal combustion
              engine, a technology that Benz also pioneered. The Motorwagen was
              a culmination of Benz's lifelong passion for engineering and a
              bold step into uncharted technological territory. It featured a
              single-cylinder four-stroke engine, which Benz had meticulously
              designed and built, integrating several innovations that are still
              fundamental to modern internal combustion engines.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="sub_block">
            <p>
              Beyond the technical aspects of the Motorwagen, Benz's work was
              revolutionary in conceptualizing the very idea of an automobile.
              Prior attempts at creating self-propelled vehicles were largely
              adaptations of horse-drawn carriages with added engines. In
              contrast, Benz's Motorwagen was designed from the ground up as a
              self-contained, motorized vehicle. It represented a radical
              departure from traditional modes of transportation and a leap into
              a new era of mobility. In 1886, Benz received a patent for his
              invention, marking the official birth of the automobile and
              securing his place in history.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="sub_block">
            <p>
              Karl Benz's contributions, however, extended beyond the invention
              of the Motorwagen. He continued to innovate and improve upon his
              designs, refining the concept of the automobile and making it more
              practical and reliable. His later models featured gear shifts, a
              clutch, a water-cooled radiator, and other advancements that
              enhanced the vehicle's functionality. Benz also understood the
              importance of marketing his invention. His wife, Bertha Benz,
              famously undertook a long-distance journey in one of his
              automobiles in 1888, demonstrating its practicality to a wider
              audience and effectively engaging in one of the earliest forms of
              automotive marketing.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="sub_block">
            <p>
              The legacy of Karl Benz is not merely in the machinery he created
              but in the profound impact his work had on society. The invention
              of the automobile revolutionized personal mobility, transforming
              the economic and social fabric of the 19th and 20th centuries. It
              spurred the development of new industries, reshaped urban
              landscapes, and altered the way people perceived distance and
              time. Benz's vision and ingenuity were key catalysts in this
              transformation, making him not just an inventor but a pioneer who
              reshaped the world.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="sub_block">
            <p>
              In conclusion, Karl Benz's life and work represent a seminal
              chapter in the story of human innovation. His creation of the Benz
              Patent-Motorwagen set into motion a series of events that led to
              the world as we know it today, dominated by the presence of motor
              vehicles. Benz's legacy is immortalized in the Mercedes-Benz
              brand, a testament to his enduring impact on the automotive
              industry and beyond. His journey from a visionary engineer to the
              father of the automobile underscores the power of innovation and
