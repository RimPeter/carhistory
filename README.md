## Design and Color Scheme

In designing the **Car History** website, special attention was given to the color scheme and typography to create a visually engaging and thematic experience for the users.

### Color Selection
For the primary color scheme, I chose a palette centered around _"sand brown"_. This color choice was made with the theme of car history in mind, believing it perfectly encapsulates the essence of the site. The shades of "sand brown" were carefully selected using [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) to ensure a cohesive and engaging visual experience.

### Font Style
The typography on the Car History website follows the font style used in the "Love Running" project. This decision was made to ensure readability and visual appeal. The color of the text is in harmony with the background color scheme, adhering to the "sand brown" palette. This approach creates a seamless and aesthetically pleasing interface.
